# YOLOv10 : Real Time Detection
![alt text](images/image1.png)
### <span style="color:yellow; font-weight:bold">YOLOv10</span> introduces a new approach to post-processing techniques in object detection methods. It significantly reduces the latency of the model.

# What is Latency ?
## <span style="color:yellow"> Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to analyze an image and tell you what objects it found. The faster the response, the lower the latency, and the smoother the experience. Itâ€™s typically measured in milliseconds (ms).
